Wenzel has used a diverse variety of media and material such as textiles, found items, animal bones, plants, soil and other organic material, as well as small electronics to produce urban interventions and objects of speculative fiction at the intersection of art, science and technology. Wenzel challenges the notion of the artwork as an object to be observed in a gallery or museum, and the gallery as a constrained space with relatively limited interactions. Her extensive body of work extends to building facades, billboards, entire neighborhoods and the city, translating into urban interventions to explore the collective production of culture and the creation and negotiation of public space.",

Dr. Yuria Celidwen will share insights from her recent book Flourishing Kin: Indigenous Wisdom for Collective Well-Being, bridging Indigenous ontologies and methodologies, academic research, and poetic expression to cultivate sustainable collective flourishing through Indigenous contemplative spiritualities and sciences. Celidwen defines relationality and flourishing as a spiritual-aesthetic arrest only possible in community through cultivating relationships toward all kin, from human to more-than-human, and the living Earth. Through poetic expression and authentic truth-telling, Celidwen invites a path that meets the world’s complexity with reverence and joyous participation in the flourishing of all living beings – RSVP Today!Event Details: Date: Tuesday, March 18, 2025Time: 5:00 – 7:00 PM ETLocation: Seely Hall, Trinity College, University of Toronto – 6 Hoskin Avenue, TorontoMeet the Speaker: Dr. Yuria Celidwen - I am a native of the Indigenous Nahua and Maya lineages from the cloud forests of Chiapas, Mexico. I am of Earth; my heart is on fire. My family is one of mystics, healers, poets, and explorers of the soil and the soul of life’s strength, tenderness, and fragility. I grew up with one wing in the wilderness and another in the magical realism of Indigenous dreamlands and stories. My Elders’ songs enthralled my childhood and enhanced my mythic imagination and emotional intuition. They’ve become the fertile soils and waters where the seeds of reverence, play, and wonder dig their roots. I am a Truth-bearer, trickster dreamer, and culture-shifter. As a scholar, I research Indigenous forms of contemplation and the transcendent experience embodied in prosocial behavior (reverence, ethics, compassion, and a sense of awe, love, and sacredness).‎ I call my research broader statement the “Ethics of Belonging,” encouraging awareness, intention, and relational actions toward planetary flourishing and a path of meaning and participation rooted in honoring Life. I am affiliated with the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, where I research Earth-based contemplation and collective flourishing in Indigenous traditions of the world. Alongside this, I am a senior fellow at the Othering and Belonging Institute; and for the American Academy of Religion, I co-chair the Indigenous Religious Traditions Unit and am on the steering committee of the Contemplative Studies Unit.RSVP Today!",
