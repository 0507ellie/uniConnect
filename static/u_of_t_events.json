We will also award the Morley Gunderson Prize which honours current students or alumni who combine outstanding personal achievement with significant service to the Centre. This is a free event and all are welcome. This event is sold out for in-person. You may attend virtually via livestream. Time is our scarcest resource. Compared to income, the amount of time at our disposal has grown much less rapidly over the last century. That’s true in rich countries, like Canada and the U.S., but is increasingly also true in less developed countries. For the average working adult, work time constitutes barely 20 percent of the typical week. It is only the second most common activity, being far behind sleep time, but slightly ahead of TV-watching; and yet, economists and others analyze work time much more thoroughly than the more important non-work time. This lecture discusses both work and non-work, concentrating particularly on differences in how time is spent across such characteristics as gender, age, immigrant status, and income, and on how it is used differently across counties. Dr. Daniel Hamermesh focuses on how the shortage of time affects behavior, and how these effects differ across these same demographic and economic characteristics. He asks the question: What would we do with the extra time if we suddenly got more time each day, week, or year? The answer is surprising and fairly distressing, but his talk culminates with a discussion of policies that might make the increasing scarcity of time less burdensome.",

        "desc": "Today, the legacy of classical film theory – with its insistence on medium specificity and concern with the formal properties of film– is often framed as essentialist, ahistorical, and no longer applicable to our present media practices. As recent media-theoretical debates challenge the very association of media with the material basis of artistic or communication devices, several scholars have shifted their focus to the categories of formats and platforms, while others proposed to new conceptual formations such as elemental media, operational media, and environmental media. This lecture seeks to complicate such views regarding the distinction between the classical and current theoretical debates by drawing attention to more dynamic and historically-contingent aspects in classical film theory’s conceptions of media. Specifically, my focus is on the writings of Rudolf Arnheim, perhaps the film theorist most identified with a rigid formalist view of medium specificity. Yet, as this lecture details, Arnheim’s conception of the film medium was far more complex than merely considering it as the material support of moving images. His thoughts on media across the eight decades of his extraordinary long career prompt us to adopt a distinct understanding of medium, while also revealing that the notions of platforms and formats already introduced themselves as vital critical categories in the context of the transformation of cinema during the twentieth century.

Cassandra Lord and Dr. Sheila Batacharya discussing Dr. Charania’s book Fighting Feelings: Lessons in Gendered Racism and Queer Life. Racialized women and girls often feel racial injustice before they have the words to name it. Sometimes they fight these feelings, and sometimes they use these feelings to fight. In this important and revealing book, Gulzar R. Charania puts the experiences of women of colour at the centre of her investigation, sharing how they endure everyday racism, as well as its lasting impacts and exacting costs in their lives and educational trajectories. Fighting Feelings highlights how the elasticity of white supremacy invites people of colour to be its accomplices, how interlocking forms of oppression force racialized queer women to calibrate the risk of expressing their sexuality, and how schools and the nation inform the development of racial literacy. Charania traces the complex convergences, and inseparability, of race, class, gender, and sexuality in women’s lives, and the divergent political horizons that racism fosters. Told through a clear analytic lens, Fighting Feelings articulates racism as a structure, and explores the myriad ways it shapes the lives and political formation of women of colour. Charania’s analysis of the complexity of racism makes this book a critical and necessary contribution to our understanding of how white supremacy operates.",

Wenzel has used a diverse variety of media and material such as textiles, found items, animal bones, plants, soil and other organic material, as well as small electronics to produce urban interventions and objects of speculative fiction at the intersection of art, science and technology. Wenzel challenges the notion of the artwork as an object to be observed in a gallery or museum, and the gallery as a constrained space with relatively limited interactions. Her extensive body of work extends to building facades, billboards, entire neighborhoods and the city, translating into urban interventions to explore the collective production of culture and the creation and negotiation of public space.",

Our world faces crises that require a focus on community and planetary health and well-being, but the Western mindfulness movement is primarily focused on individual self-improvement. Dr. Yuria Celidwen will share insights from her recent book Flourishing Kin: Indigenous Wisdom for Collective Well-Being, bridging Indigenous ontologies and methodologies, academic research, and poetic expression to cultivate sustainable collective flourishing through Indigenous contemplative spiritualities and sciences. Celidwen defines relationality and flourishing as a spiritual-aesthetic arrest only possible in community through cultivating relationships toward all kin, from human to more-than-human, and the living Earth.

Marybel Menzies will be discussing the ethical significance of the minimally conscious state (MCS). To do this, she will respond to a position she names the \"fate worse than death view\". She will then analyze current neuroscientific evidence for mental state activity in patients diagnosed MCS, as well as perform a value theoretical analysis of these mental states to determine whether they are prudentially valuable. Menzies will show that research suggests MCS patients retain significant neural activity in regions associated with emotional processing. This preserved neural activity correlated with specific mental states that have prudential value—particularly, she argues that emotional states are prudentially valuable. To establish her position, she addresses two objections, including the inverse inference and adaptive preference objection. The conclusion has implications for clinical ethics and treatment decisions because it suggests that prudentially valuable mental states give rise to interests, which ought to be factored into decision-making by clinicians. Thus, while the ethical challenges surrounding MCS remain complex, Menzies suggests the presence of prudentially valuable mental states in these patients must be appreciated.

        "desc": "Ariel LaFayette, in the PhD program at U of T, focuses on philosophy of religion in the 19th & 20th centuries. More broadly, her research interests include the history of phenomenology, Christian ethics, existentialism, and the philosophy of love (within the context of the philosophy of religion). She has presented at the World Congress of Philosophy, Rome (2024); the 17th Annual PGSO Conference on Religious Experiences at the University of Southern Florida (2024); the European Academy of Religion (2024), and the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard University (2022). Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard’s Works of Love offers a controversial interpretation of the commandment, “love your neighbor as yourself.” In the penultimate chapter entitled \"The Work of Love in Recollecting the One Who is Dead,\" Kierkegaard establishes a tenuous relationship between the work of love in recollecting the one who is dead and his broader theory of neighbourly love. My presentation focuses on Kierkegaard’s claim that recollection’s love is the most faithful, free, and unselfish. After reconstructing this claim, I argue that recollection’s way of loving is not directly transferable to neighbourly love, since the latter activity runs the risk of compromising the individual's freedom and faith. I argue this point by examining some of the pseudonymous perspectives in Kierkegaard's corpus (e.g. Johannes Climacus/A from Either/Or Part 1, the \"young man\" from Repetition) who successfully optimize their freedom and faith through recollecting a dead beloved, but fail to satisfy the conditions of neighbourly love.",
