        "name": "Evaluating the Role of Recollection in Kierkegaard, Works of Love",
        "desc": "Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard’s Works of Love offers a controversial interpretation of the commandment, “love your neighbor as yourself.” In the penultimate chapter entitled \"The Work of Love in Recollecting the One Who is Dead,\" Kierkegaard establishes a tenuous relationship between the work of love in recollecting the one who is dead and his broader theory of neighbourly love. My presentation focuses on Kierkegaard’s claim that recollection’s love is the most faithful, free, and unselfish. After reconstructing this claim, I argue that recollection’s way of loving is not directly transferable to neighbourly love, since the latter activity runs the risk of compromising the individual's freedom and faith. I argue this point by examining some of the pseudonymous perspectives in Kierkegaard's corpus (e.g. Johannes Climacus/A from Either/Or Part 1, the \"young man\" from Repetition) who successfully optimize their freedom and faith through recollecting a dead beloved, but fail to satisfy the conditions of neighbourly love.",
