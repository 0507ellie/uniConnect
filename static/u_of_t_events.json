We will also award the Morley Gunderson Prize which honours current students or alumni who combine outstanding personal achievement with significant service to the Centre. This is a free event and all are welcome. This event is sold out for in-person. You may attend virtually via livestream. Time is our scarcest resource. Compared to income, the amount of time at our disposal has grown much less rapidly over the last century. That’s true in rich countries, like Canada and the U.S., but is increasingly also true in less developed countries. For the average working adult, work time constitutes barely 20 percent of the typical week. It is only the second most common activity, being far behind sleep time, but slightly ahead of TV-watching; and yet, economists and others analyze work time much more thoroughly than the more important non-work time. This lecture discusses both work and non-work, concentrating particularly on differences in how time is spent across such characteristics as gender, age, immigrant status, and income, and on how it is used differently across counties. Dr. Daniel Hamermesh focuses on how the shortage of time affects behavior, and how these effects differ across these same demographic and economic characteristics. He asks the question: What would we do with the extra time if we suddenly got more time each day, week, or year? The answer is surprising and fairly distressing, but his talk culminates with a discussion of policies that might make the increasing scarcity of time less burdensome.",

This woman, Faustine, recorded by a machine, in her concept and abstraction, becomes the conducting thread of all the ideas that traverse Broomer’s film. Like Morel (and the fugitive), the filmmaker designs this feminine figure through digital codes, giving her a new texture. It’s Lulu who scapes the expressive humanity of Pabst, to be molded to the eyes of a different creator, many years after, given new life with the help of technology.” Mónica Delgado, Desistfilm",

In Indenture Aesthetics, Jordache A. Ellapen examines the visual and performance art practices of feminist, queer, femme, and gender-nonconforming Afro-Indian and South African black artists to understand the paradoxes of freedom in contemporary South Africa. Tracing the afterlife of apartheid-era racial categories and revisiting Bantu Stephen Biko’s Black Consciousness, Ellapen theorizes South African blackness through the Indian Ocean World, showing how the development of an Afro-Indian identity after generations of indentured labor and segregation troubles persistent racial hierarchies. Staging unexpected encounters between artists such as Sharlene Khan, Mohau Modisakeng, Lebohang Kganye, and Reshma Chhiba, he analyzes how their works challenge these racial categories to create new imaginaries of freedom. Situated in a context in which the authentic (hetero)normative black subject of the post-apartheid state is bracketed from other formulations of blackness, these artists’ aesthetic practices, alongside those of other artists like Ellapen himself, disrupt desires for national belonging and catalyze alternative and transgressive politics and subjects. By rethinking the relationship between blackness, Afro-Indianness, and Africanness, Ellapen highlights the role of the aesthetic in crafting a blueprint for coalitional building across difference in contemporary South Africa.",

Cassandra Lord and Dr. Sheila Batacharya discussing Dr. Charania’s book Fighting Feelings: Lessons in Gendered Racism and Queer Life. Racialized women and girls often feel racial injustice before they have the words to name it. Sometimes they fight these feelings, and sometimes they use these feelings to fight. In this important and revealing book, Gulzar R. Charania puts the experiences of women of colour at the centre of her investigation, sharing how they endure everyday racism, as well as its lasting impacts and exacting costs in their lives and educational trajectories.",

Dr. Yuria Celidwen will share insights from her recent book Flourishing Kin: Indigenous Wisdom for Collective Well-Being, bridging Indigenous ontologies and methodologies, academic research, and poetic expression to cultivate sustainable collective flourishing through Indigenous contemplative spiritualities and sciences. Celidwen defines relationality and flourishing as a spiritual-aesthetic arrest only possible in community through cultivating relationships toward all kin, from human to more-than-human, and the living Earth. Through poetic expression and authentic truth-telling, Celidwen invites a path that meets the world’s complexity with reverence and joyous participation in the flourishing of all living beings – RSVP Today!",
