## ðŸ’¡ Problem

UofT colleges promote events across flyers, emails, and scattered Instagram accounts. Many students miss out on opportunities due to this fragmented communication. UniConnect unifies these sources into one web platform, allowing for search, filtering, and personalized event recommendations.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

**Source:** Event pages from 6 UofT college websites:
- University College
- Woodsworth College
- Innis College
- New College
- Victoria College
- Trinity College


**Scraping Pipeline:**
- Scrape HTML via Selenium & BeautifulSoup
- Extract structured event data via LLM APIs
- Store as JSON for backend usage

---

## ðŸ§® Computation & Tree Structure

Events are stored in a **tree** for efficient filtering and recommendation:

---

### Core Computations
- **Scraping & Parsing**: Web scraping + LLMs to extract inconsistent HTML formats
- **Tree Building**: Events organized by weekday â†’ college â†’ category
- **Filtering**: Traverse tree nodes to match filters
- **Sorting**: Radix sort based on UNIX timestamps
- **Recommendation**: Score events based on user preferences
